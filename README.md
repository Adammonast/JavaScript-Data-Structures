# JavaScript Data Structures Review

> This repository contains all my review into data structures using JavaScript

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

This repository is useful for any developer looking to take a deep dive into JavaScript data structures. Within the each file are fully built-out functions and methods with comments thoroughly explaning what each piece of the code is doing. I created and utilized this project for the computer science portion of the Lambda School curriculum.

Future plans for this project include: adding more comments to the data structures without them (LL, graphs, etc) and adding code challenges with test files to further practice this material.
